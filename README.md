# monkeys-and-typewriters
So one day I had this silly idea after being inspired by this million checkbox thingy.

I thought, "what if you could combine this with the concept of 'Twitch plays' stuff" and
so this is the result. Just a simple little server that is messily sketched up to allow people to try and type out hamlet.

## Why Hamlet?

There's a quip that goes, "if you put an infinite amount of monkeys in a room with typewriters, they will eventually produce the works of Shakespeare."

This is just a play on the idea that an infinite process can produce an infinite amount of
information, but I decided to take it more literally. Hello monkeys :)
